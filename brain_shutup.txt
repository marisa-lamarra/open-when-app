If you open this I know your mind is probably racing right now, so like jumping from one thought to the next, replaying things, overanalysing/thinking, maybe even stressing about stuff that hasn’t even happened (and probably won’t) I think I once made a quote but I don’t know if I told you. Basically my quote is (and it’s Daphne approved) why are we going to spend half the time worrying about something that hasn’t happened, to then get to said thing, or experience said thing, and it be fine? Like what is the point? You’d surely rather get there with an open mind and be like well this is shit, can’t wait for a debrief and a glass of wine later?  But I also know that when you get like this, it’s hard to slow down.

So a few things that help me that I think might help you. Go on Wim Hof youtube and do the beginner breathing. Don’t worry if you feel like you’re dying cos I also feel like that. If you can’t do it, or can’t do it cos you're doing something else – imagine me trying to do it and almost dying from oxygen deprivation in my corpse position x Honestly though, it helps.

You don’t have to figure everything out right now (unless you’re at work in which case…. Bad news for you... code red? Blue? You did tell me). Your brain might be telling you that you do, but you don’t. Whatever’s running circles in your head will still be there tomorrow, and I promise the world won’t fall apart if you take a step back for a bit. Maybe even tomorrow with fresh eyes it won’t even seem that big, and you can work through it.

If your thoughts are really loud, try writing them down or saying them out loud – you’ve probably already been told this by a professional. Sometimes, when you see them or hear them, they don’t feel as overwhelming, plus when you write them out you can actually see where they stem from sometimes. If that doesn’t help, distract yourself—music, a show, gym, a drive. And if nothing works, just remind yourself: thoughts aren’t facts. Just because your brain is telling you something doesn’t make it true.

I know this isn’t easy, and I know sometimes it feels impossible to quiet your mind. But you’ve been here before, and you’ve gotten through it every single time & you’ll get through this too.
