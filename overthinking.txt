You’ve probably opened this for multiple reasons, and that’s okay. If it’s about us, I want you to know that we’ve got this figured out. We will always figure it out. If there’s something you need from me, all you have to do is ask. I’m here for you, even if it isn’t the easiest thing for me. We’re a team, and I’m always going to be here to support you.

If you’re overthinking because of the past and some things I did, please know that I can never take words or actions back, but I am constantly learning and growing from them. I’m doing my best to be the person you deserve, and I genuinely like you—more than I can say. You’re my girl, my bestie, and I would do anything for you. There’s no one in this world who could compare to you in my eyes, and I want you to always remember that. You’re irreplaceable.

I believe we’re strong enough to get through anything but we shouldnt need to, and if I’m acting weird, pull me up on it (I’m probably writing this on my notes app). Nothing could break us at this point.

If you're overthinking in general… girl, I get it. Anxiety is a tough one to deal with. And because you’ve had it for so long, you probably even overthink the fact that you overthink, which I can imagine drives you crazy! But, and I know it’s easy for me to say, overthinking doesn’t define you, and it doesn’t mean that what you’re thinking is real. So, I ask—what’s the proof? If you have proof, then yeah, I get it—overthink it. But if you don’t, just try to take a step back. What’s the root of it? Is it something you can work on, or do you need to talk to me or one of your friends?

I want you to know that you are never a burden to any of us, and even if what you’re overthinking seems small or stupid to you, it’s never silly to us. We care about you. Overthinking is normal, and it doesn’t make you any less of a person. Just let yourself come back to reality. It’s going to be okay, and you’re going to be okay.
