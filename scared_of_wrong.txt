It's so easy to fall into that trap of worrying about what could go wrong. But honestly, what's the point? If we have something good, if we really care about each other and have built this strong foundation, then why worry about the what-ifs? The "what ifs" are just fears and possibilities that might never even happen.


I’ve shared with you all the things I appreciate about you – how amazing you are, how we’ve grown together, how we make each other better. So why would I let fear take that away? If we have something special, that’s all that matters.


We've got a good thing going, and there’s no point in letting anxiety about what could happen stop us from enjoying what is happening.


So, let's focus on the good, the present, and the love we’ve got. Anything else? We can deal with that together. We’re stronger than the “what ifs.
