Wait, you miss me? When I probably haven't left you alone all day, haha. Well, I miss you way more than I can put into words. I know we both have really busy lives and full-time jobs, but just remember—I’m literally only 20 minutes down the road now.

If I’m the reason you miss me, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to make you feel that way. I was probably epileptic, or work piled up, and I had to cancel a date or didn’t message you back right away—it would never be intentional. If that’s why you miss me, just let me know, and I’ll make it up to you.

At least we’re not long distance anymore. So if you’re missing me, just know I miss you 500 times more, and I’m probably praying I’ll be back with you as soon as possible. I will literally see you any time you need me.

If you miss me, look through the pictures you haven’t deleted, or go back to my email with all the reasons why I like you. Or just call me—twice, because I’ll be on DND. 

I know you love your independence, but it’s okay to miss me. Let me know what you need, and I’ll do it. I can’t wait to be next to you again.
