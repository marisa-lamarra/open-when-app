GET OFF OF TIKTOK. Stop it. I swear there’s nothing on there that’s good past 9pm. It’s probably my retweets of Jamaican homeless rabbits, and if you keep scrolling, it’s just going to get worse (Indian homeless rabbits…seriously, stop).


What's on your mind? Are you overthinking, or is it just that you can’t get comfy? Do you have your noo noos with you? Have you eaten something or had a nice Horlicks? I know I’m being a hypocrite here, but have you written down your thoughts? Can Alison or Fred help? What’s up, babe? :(


I usually sleep early, but just know you can always message me, and I’ll reply when I can. Everything will be okay. All you have to do is just relax and know that your body needs rest, even if you’re trying to do 10,000 things at once. You’ll get tired soon enough. Please don’t wear yourself out too much. A good sleep will make everything feel better.


PS. on further review, idk why I wrote this one because youre always asleep.
