If you don’t want to speak to me right now, then you’ve probably opened this one. I know I’ve hurt you somehow, or made a mistake, and I can imagine that you’re angry when you’re reading this. I’m so sorry. I want to take full responsibility for my actions, and I completely understand why you’d be upset.


Please know that I am holding myself accountable for what I’ve done, and when you’re ready, I will explain myself and do everything I can to learn from this, because I want to be the best version of myself for you. I’m not asking for forgiveness right away, or at all—I’m just sorry that I’ve hurt you to the point where you feel like you need to open this letter in the first place.


I care about you so much, and I want to do right by you. I want to be better, for us. I will do better. You are so important to me, and I am truly sorry. I am here when you’re ready to talk, if you want to.
