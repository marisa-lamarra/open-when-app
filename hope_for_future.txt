Hey babe, I know you’ve been thinking a lot about how you’ll manage 'doing life' or being an adult on your own. I totally get it. Things didn’t go as planned when you moved into the flat, and that can make everything feel heavier, like you’re not quite where you need to be. But guess what? You’re still here! I think 18-year-old Livvy would be amazed by how far you’ve come (not in a dark way, I promise). Sometimes it’s easy to forget just how much you’ve achieved, and I know it’s been tough.

I also know that your health sometimes isn’t great, and you tend to worry about literally everything. You’re probably even concerned about the animals in the world dying before you see them all. The future feels huge, and I can understand how overwhelming that can be. But here’s the thing: nobody has all the answers, babe. Nobody expects you to either. The only thing you can do is what you’ve already done which is keep going.

Not to get all philosophical, but is anyone really ever at the ‘right’ point in time? Worrying about reaching a destination doesn’t change where it is, does it? The future is always going to be there, and the fact that you’re still making it through each day proves you can do this. You can do life.

As for our future? Where do I even begin? You and me are going to be just fine. We know each other inside and out, and there’s nothing you could do that would make me think you’re not worthy of a future with me. The reason we’re together right now is because we’re working towards literal marriage. I never thought I’d marry anyone. You’re the light in my life, and I don’t want to do life without you in it. I know we can do this, and I’m so sure of it. Just imagine we’re already sitting here arguing about how much annual leave I have left for our eighth holiday. 

So please, just remember—you can do this. Your life is yours, and the future is yours to shape.
