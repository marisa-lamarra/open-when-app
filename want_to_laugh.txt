If you’re opening this, it means you need a good laugh—so I've thought of a few things that might help but it is a work in progress:

When I got misgendered

When we were in Nells and I thought the pizza was ours and I was like "mmm that'll be ours" but it wasn't

When we were in Nells and I dropped the sauce and you wiped it off the table and still ate it

When the screen at the Odeon keep going ZOOOOOOOOOM

When we were coming back from coffee and you sped up to my uber driver and he called you my funny friend

When you farted in my face in Venice

Mr & Mrs Sootcase

Having to scramble to put the cover on your outside sofas when it rained and it probably being recorded on your mum's ring camera

Abygail showing you a picture of yourself when you asked her who she fancied

Michael Jackson tramp Jess sticker

When I fell down the stairs in GAY at pride and twisted my ankle

Chinese Whale

When I had a buzz cut

Harry thinking AIDS is passed on via air fryers


Honestly I feel like we've got into so many stupid situations together or by ourselves and they make me laugh all the time so hopefully that helps a bit. You always make me laugh because you’re unintentionally hilarious.

You have the best laugh. Like, it actually makes me laugh (you go like ha HA proper manc), even when I don’t know what we’re laughing about.

You are actually funny, even when you’re not trying to be (autism to be honest).

I love that I can just be myself with you and that you don't care if I say something stupid

If all else fails, go look at the sticker I made of your toe. And if you’re still not laughing, I’ll fix that as soon as I see you.
