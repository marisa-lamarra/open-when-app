Sister Liv, where do I even start? I remember when you were a student nurse, they had you doing things way above your pay grade, and yet you still handled it all because you’re such a dedicated nurse. And you are good at your job. They’re lucky to have you on that team. I see how hard you’re working, and I’m really proud of you.


I know it can feel overwhelming at times, especially with some of the heavy stuff you deal with daily, stuff that’s hard for me to even imagine. But how amazing is it that you love your profession so much, that you care so deeply about it? It’s clear that your just a caring person, and you’re on it in there. You’re so intelligent, and I’m sure you’re always being asked for advice or guidance.


I know sometimes it feels like you have to bear all the stress, but just remember: they appreciate you. You’re an incredible nurse. And if you ever need extra help, or just a moment to sit down, don’t hesitate to ask. I know it’s probably hard in A&E, but it’s important to take that space when you need it.


You’re capable of handling so much more than you give yourself credit for. And I’m always here to listen even if I have no idea what you’re talking about sometimes.
