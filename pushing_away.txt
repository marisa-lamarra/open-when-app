Alright, you’re probably reading this because either a) you’re doubting us (see 'Open when you’re doubting us'), b) I’ve been too much (I know, shock!), or c) you’re feeling anxious. Maybe there’s a d), but that’s for you to fill in the blank and let me know, and I’ll give you reassurance on that too.


First off: please don’t push me away. It’s tough on both of us. When you’re distant, it hurts, and I tend to overcompensate by getting a bit too clingy or smothering, which just pushes you even further away. But this isn’t about me, it’s about you feeling safe and respected. So, please just tell me. If you’re pushing me away, just say it: 'Marisa, I need space because of XYZ.' At least then I know where we stand.


If you need some time to yourself, take it. Go to get a disgusting drink from starbs, go the gym, go for a drive or whatever helps. You’ve always got a million things running through your mind, and I know it’s hard to navigate all that with me around messaging you or annoying you. If you need quiet time, I respect that. I trust you, even though I know you sometimes feel like I don’t. I’d never get weird or make you feel stupid for needing space. You’re your own person, and I love how independent you are. 


You don’t have to feel like it’s a push and pull. I’m not going anywhere, so don’t hesitate to talk to me. I’m always here to listen.
