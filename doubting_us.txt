If you're reading this one then I bet you are in your "we are never going to be right for eachother and we aren't gonna work :/" mindsets and then you get stuck in it don't you?


I know, we’ve been through this before. We’ve tried a lot of times, and sometimes it can feel like we’re just going in circles. But if you can, just think where do these doubts come from? Is it something I have done, a feeling, or something else? Do you need something from me that I’m not giving you? Or maybe you just need space to breathe for a bit. Whatever it is, you can tell me. You have every right to be open with me, and I want to know what’s going on for you. I’m here to listen.


Remember, I chose you. We always choose each other and find a way back to eachother. I know we’ve had our challenges, but think about how much easier things are now. We’ve grown so much together, and we’re able to talk about things that used to be so hard to discuss. I’m proud of how far we’ve come and of the new version of us. We’ve become stronger, more mature, and better at life in my opinion.


I’m not going anywhere (not meant to be threatening). I don’t see my future without you in it. I know that when things get tough, you might start thinking back on old patterns, getting scared that maybe this is where things fall apart, or you wonder if I really like you, or if we’ll really work out. I understand that fear, because I feel it too sometimes. But you’re not alone in this. I’ve seen us face challenges before together. And even when we didn’t solve everything right away, we always came back to each other. We'll never be perfect but I don't really think that exists.


I know we’ve built something real here, and we’ve learned that we can work through anything. I don’t want to do this with anyone else but you. If you’re still feeling doubt, just take a moment to read this again. Look at what we’ve built, and let that be your reminder. If you ever need to talk about it, I’m always here. You can message me whenever. I trust us, and I know we can figure anything out.
