I can tell when you’re worn out, usually cos of your texts or the way you just want to sleep. It’s okay to be tired. You’re literally on your feet for 12 hours, and then everything else in your mind piles up too. Even a ‘normal’ day can take its toll, and I’d never judge you for feeling stressed, even if you didn’t do a single thing.


You’re allowed to need an outlet, to relax, and just breathe. I know you’re capable of carrying everything on your own (you're a bad bitch, after all) but you don’t have to. I’m here for you. Always.


Take a step back, and look at how much you do for the people around you. You don’t have to deal with it all alone. If something’s stressing you out, even if it feels stupid, tell me. I love listening to you vent, no matter what it’s about. I’ll never tell you it’s ‘silly’ or that you shouldn’t be stressed. I get that things hit differently for you, and I respect that.


So, what’s causing the stress today? Is it something that can be solved quickly or will it take a bit more time? If it’s the latter, tell it to f*ck off. If it’s something that can be sorted in a few minutes or hours, I know you’ve got it. But most importantly, make sure you rest. I know you love being out and about, doing everything you can, but sometimes you just need to pause. No one is judging you for it.
