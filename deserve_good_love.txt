I know I’ve been guilty of giving you shit you didn’t deserve. I’ve made you feel like you’re not enough when you absolutely are, and I know sometimes you internalize that. But you need to know, you’re a bad ass b*tch, and none of that was ever your fault. You deserve good love that’s kind, genuine, and real.


I also know it’s hard for you to believe that someone could like you for more than just your looks or your body. But I do. I like you for everything you are, inside and out. You deserve every ounce of kindness, affection, and even the cringe-y moments because you’re worth it.


You don’t need to keep up this wall of “I’m not letting anyone in.” I understand where it comes from, but you don’t have to carry that anymore. You give so much love to everyone around you, and it doesn’t go unnoticed. Your family is lucky to have you! You have such a good bond with your brother, even if he can drive you mad sometimes. Your parents are proud of you for the woman you’ve become, and your grandparents know they can rely on you, too.


You’ve got friends (even across the world now), and I can see how much you care about each and every one of them. Your patients definitley love you, and you make those kids’ days better, even if their parents can be awful. Please don’t ever doubt that what you put out into the world is seen and appreciated.


I know sometimes you wonder, ‘Why is this happening to me?’ but STOPPPPPP. There’s always something good coming because people like you don’t just exist by accident. You’re here for a reason, and you are so, so loved.


I want to be the best version of myself for you, so you’ll never have to question again whether you deserve anything less than the best.
