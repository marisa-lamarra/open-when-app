Literally everything is going to be okay. I wish I could be there with you right now to just give you a big hug and remind you in person that you’re going to be okay. I know sometimes everything feels like it’s too much, and I so wish I could provide you with that comfort in person.

Sometimes things feel heavy, and you just need that physical reassurance, a hug to make it feel like everything will be alright. Honestly, I love being able to hold you, to touch you, and make you feel safe. It’s okay to need that comfort and connection.

Even though I can’t physically be there right now, just know that I’m sending all my warmth and care to you. I’ll always be here when you need me.
